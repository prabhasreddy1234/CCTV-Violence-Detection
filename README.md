# CCTV-Violence-Detection
This project aims to develop an AI-powered violence detection system that analyzes CCTV footage to identify violent activities in real time. The system is designed specifically for girls' paying guest accommodations to enhance safety by detecting violent behavior and triggering an alert mechanism (buzzer sound) when violence is detected.
